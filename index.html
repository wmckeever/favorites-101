  <h1>William McKeever</h1>
  <hr>
  <div>
    <p>As stated above, my name is <span class="highlight">William McKeever</span> and I am currently living in Ithaca, New York. I chose this program because after working for over a decade in the nonprofit sector, I wanted a change in both work and lifestyle. In doing my research, I learned that web development is a progressing field and I wanted to take part in that. And, thanks to VRAAP I am able to do so.</p>

    <p>That being said, the more that I delve into this world I am finding that I am being drawn more to web application development and am very much looking forward to learning the full <strong>MERN</strong> stack.
